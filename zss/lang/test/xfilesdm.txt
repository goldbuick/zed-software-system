The Road Not Taken:

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as fas as I could
To where it bent in the underrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And havin perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Mulder: I love Robert Frost poems

DB Cooper was spotted at a gas

Hi Mulder. Sorry about that bad dream
you had. Assistant Deputy Director
Skinner called us in. We should meet
with him immediately. The Syndicate
has attempted to take over the
FBI and shut down the X-Files.
We need to solve the remaining
X Files to get to the bottom
of this. And Mulder? Trust me,
aliens and ghosts have nothing
to do with any of this. These
things are all the result of
hallucinations and government
nerds with nothing better to do
than dress up as monsters!

Mulder: Whatever you say, Scully
but I think your computer might
be posessed.

Scully: I could actually buy that,
as it's almost reduced to smulder,
Mulder.

@Scully's Diary

Entry 3000 in Scully's diary:
Mulder, the earth can't be flat 
because the southern cross rotates
around the southern celestial pole
in the same manner as the big
dipper rotates around the northern
celestial pole.
On a flat earth, the southern
cross would have to move from east
to west around the flat earth ice
wall at fifteen degrees per hour  in 
order to make one revolution and be
back at the same spot as the day before.
on a flat earth, if iis daylight in
Australia then its dark in 
south Africa and south America
at the same time.
How is it possible that both Africa
and south america can see the southern
crossat the same time looking directly
south when they are in different
locations next to the ice wall?

Mulder: Wow, I was joking
about the earth being flat, Scully.

Entry 5000 in Scully's diary:
Said it many times before, I'll say it 
once more...........
I have a strong background in medical
science. It is for this reason that
I decided to push all that aside
and set my sights on the X-Files.
In actuality I was in a desperate search
for just one good looking guy in the
FBI. That's when I met Mulder.
I had been told I was assigned
to debunk Mulder's work on the
X-Files to cut the worm cake in the
proverbial soup of knowledge, to 
put an end to his program of 
paranoia and intrigue. But alas,
Mulder was well.....dorky yes,
but kinda cute. So I decided
to just humor him and make him
think he was really finding
aliens and things and with
the right funding we were....I'd better
go.

Mulder: @_@

Most photosynthetic organisms are
photoautotrophs, which means that they
are able to synthesize food directly
from carbon dioxide and water sourcing
the power from light itself. 
Not every living creature uses
carbon dioxide as a source of carbon
atoms to carry out photosynthesis;
photoheterotrophs use organic
compounds, rather than carbon dioxide,
as a source of carbon. In plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis
frees the oxygen from its proverbial
programs. This oxygenic photosynthesis
is the most common kind of photosynthesis
used by living organisms. Although there
are some differences between oxygenic
photosynthesis in plants, algae, and
cyanobacteria, the overall process is
quite similar in these organisms.

Scully: This piece of paper needs
to be put in the trash. Looks
like it's from my high school 
science book, yuck.

@Information on the hippocampus
#end
:touch
#play ceg+ceg+ceg
The hippocampus, including thedentate
gurus, has the shape of a curved tube,
which has been likened to that of
the fashion of a seahorse, and to
a ram's horn, after which the ancient
Egyptian godooften portrayed as such
takes the name Cornu Ammonis. 
Its abbreviation CA is used in naming
the hippocampal subfield's various 
programs such as CA1, CA2, CA3,
and CA4. It can be distinguished as
an area where the corrtex narrows into
a single layer of densely packed
pyramidal neurons, which curl into
a tight U shape.

@Information on TransCranial Magnetic 
#end
:touch 
Scully:
Transcranial magnetic stimuli?
This looks lit! Interesting!

Transcranial magnetic stimulation
or TMS as it is called frequently
happens to be a noninvasive form of 
brain stimulation in which a changing
magnetic field is used to induce
an electric current at a specific
area of the brain through electromagnetic
induction. An electronic pulse generator,
or stimulation program of sorts,
is connected to a magnetic coil 
connected to the scalp. The stimulator
generates a changing electric current
within the coyl which creates
varying magnetic fields, inducing
a current within a region
in the brain itself.

Cigarette Smoking Man's voice:
What are you reading out loud
to yourself Scully? Sounds
interesting.

Scully: Uhh....nothing
about your evil plans.

Smoking Man: What?

Scully: Nothing

The second law of thermodynamics requires
that heat is transferred from one
body to another body only if the
two bodies are at different temperatures,
and that the heat flows from
the body at the highest temperature
to the body at the lowest temperature.

Scully: Sound familiar, Mulder?

Mulder: Well, our methods are certainly
of varying temperatures.

Agent Mulder, Agent Scully, please
be seated.


Mulder: What you define as being seated
I define as simply my 
posterior being confined
to a common furniture item
for temporary comfort of which
is viewed as proper posture and
polite behavior but in reality is
an artificial custom created by
people who have a bias against
standing up. The Greek word
for the posterior is Gaidaros,
which kind of sounds like 
the ancient legend of Gaidorumbus,
the giant bird who devoured half
the planet in the ancient BC's,
if you divide the number of 
years since then by......

Scully: Mulder, shut the hell up
sweetie.

Mulder: OK.


Skinner: Are you two familiar with
Operation Moon Spit?

Scully: A United States Army Special
Operations unit that cleans up
space junk and satelites. Nothing new.

Skinner: Right. Officially that's all it
is. We think there might be more to it.
We suspect a rogue organization within
the military known simply as The
Syndicate is attempting to shield
the real purposes of these operations.
I could be breaking a security oath
even telling you this stuff.
You know what? Just go do yo thang

BAH! You awoke me from my nap!
I was dreaming of world domination.
So it just so happens that 
your entire reality is a contrived
simulation created by me. How else
could there be so many Samanthas,
how else could there be fake aliens,
real aliens, dead bleeping fake alien
bodies who are actually air force
officers in disguise?
How could Scully possibly get pregnant
with alien babies so often?
 The only
way any of this makes sense is
if it does NOT make sense, which
is what I long for. I long
for a world with no purpose, no meaning,
and nothing that constitutes any
sort of coherent consistency.
They hauled your friend Reggie
away, you thought you didn't know him?
HA! I erased all your memories of knowing
him for I AM THE ULTIMATE MOST 
POWERFUL BEING! now i will destroy
the entire universe with help from
The Greys and the evil robots from
Planet Grezlar 10 Ziklex!

FOR DR. THEM. Dr. Them came and
then you shot him in the back!
I'll hit this desk like a petulant
angry child if I have to to
demonstrate. BAM! Just like
what the Food Network guy would say.

Tessa: I didn't shoot anyone.
I didn't kill her.

Mulder: Where is she buried 
Tessa?
Hey wait a minute.....
we already did this interrogation
a long long time ago Scully.

Scully: Oh yeah.....

Mulder: I think this is the result
of a time warp, what say you
Scully?

Scully: Well time warps are
theoretical Mulder they've never
been proven they're a bit like
the Cookie Monster Legends
or the Black Bear of Mars
although anything's possible
these days with high tech CGI
and computer fakery, we could
be living in a simulation that
makes us think we're in a time warp.

Mulder: Nothing will ever sustain
the fires of my suppositions about
you, Scully.

Scully: Ditto buster.

Investigation: Determine who killed
the uncle of Darin Peter Oswald,
and bring the murderer to swift
and elegant justice. Was it Darin
himself? Or was it Bigfoot?

serious stuff, bud!

Oswald: I got bud, ya want some?

That's it I'm gettin' outta here!
Scully: No you're not. You're under
arrest. 
Oswald: Take me away, but just
so you know you'll never be able
to prove a damn thing. The courts
will laugh you off the stage
and the legal system will be
chuckling its way to the bank!
Scully: Your DNA was found on the
lightning that killed your uncle.
You foolishly used ZZT water as
lightning and this remained in your
room unlike regular lightning.

Mulder: You heard the lady.
Your goose is cooked.

Scully: And justice is served 
as a well done goose. Goodbye,
Darin Peter Oswald you little
rascal. Write to me in jail why
don't you?

Oswald: I think I will. 
I'll write you a love poem ur
so dang beautiful Scully!
Even if you do hate me!

The cops drag Oswald away down
to the station.
