#synth phase <degrees>
$white The phase is the starting position within 
$white the oscillator's cycle. For example a phase 
$white of 180 would start halfway through the
$white oscillator's cycle.

#synth harmonicity <number>
$white Harmonicity is the frequency ratio between 
$white the carrier and the modulator oscillators.
$white A harmonicity of 1 gives both oscillators 
$white the same frequency. Harmonicity = 2 
$white means a change of an octave.

$white Harmonicity is the frequency ratio between 
$white the carrier and the modulator oscillators.
$white A harmonicity of 1 gives both oscillators

#synth modtype <sine, square, triangle, sawtooth>
#synth modenv <a> <d> <s> <r> - in seconds
#synth modindex <degrees>
$white The modulation index which is in essence
$white the depth or amount of the modulation.
$white In other terms it is the ratio of the 
$white frequency of the modulating signal (mf) 
$white to the amplitude of the modulating signal 
$white (ma) -- as in ma/mf

#synth phase <degrees>
#synth count <number>
$white This sets the number of oscillators to 
$white spread along the given range.
#synth spread <cents>
$white This signals the number of cents between
$white oscillators.
